### Freelance Microsoft Developer

As a freelance Microsoft developer, I primarily focus on .NET Core web development using Azure and Orchard Core. I develop Orchard Core websites, themes, and modules for development firms, corporate clients, and small businesses. I also offer training, consulting, content management, maintenance and other support services for Orchard Core. You can learn more on my [Orchard Core Developer Website](https://www.orchardcore.io).

### Computer Science Tutor

I tutor college students in computer science in C, C++, Java, and Python. I help students better understand programming concepts, data structures, and algorithms. More importantly, I teach them additional skills and technologies not taught in the classroom that help them develop real-world skills as well as secure internships and careers.

### Personal Development Coach

I provide personal development coaching to individuals and groups to improve their health, fitness, mindset, and habits. I have several fitness, nutrition, and specialty certifications from NASM. I also have exercise nutrition and personal development coaching certifications from Precision Nutrition and Optimize. You can learn more about my personal development coaching and certifications on my [personal website](https://www.davidhayden.me/about).
